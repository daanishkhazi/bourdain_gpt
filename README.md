# BourdainGPT

## Overview

[BourdainGPT](https://bourdain-gpt.vercel.app/) is a project designed to provide a detailed travel-like exploration of the world's culinary traditions from your home. Users interact with a dynamic map of the world, and by clicking on a specific region, they can retrieve information about the culinary traditions of the nearest city with a population of over 100,000.

## How It Works

1. **Map Interaction**: The user clicks on a point on an equirectangular projection of the world, and the application computes the latitude and longitude of the selected location.
2. **City Identification**: The geographic coordinates are used to query the [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) API, which returns the nearest city with a population exceeding 100,000.
3. **Story Generation**: Once a city is identified, the application generates a story about its culinary tradition using LLMs. The model is prompted to describe the city and its food culture, and to share specific examples of dishes, ingredients, and festivities.

## Language Models

Choose your model - currently [deployed version](https://bourdain-gpt.vercel.app/) uses GPT-3.5-turbo.

- [**OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat): A large-scale language model capable of various natural language tasks.

- [**Fine-tuned BourdainGPT model**](https://huggingface.co/daanish-k/bourdain_gpt): Fine-tuned LLaMa 2 with quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA). We use a synthetic dataset generated by GPT-3.5-turbo for model distillation and outsized performance - see datagen folder, which describes how to create a dataset of 1000 prompt-response pairs.
